  IMPORTANT:
  Added two config options for 'unclaimed' tile entities in the config
    Whether or not unclaimed tile entities can craft anything - defaults to false
    Whether or not unclaimed tile entities can use anything for crafting = defaults to true
  If a tile is unclaimed (aka placed before progression is installed) then it will default to these options.
  The default means that noone can craft anything with a furnace made before the mod is installed. (Until they replace it, or claim it).
  The mod needs to know who placed the block, in order to perform it's craft locking actions.
